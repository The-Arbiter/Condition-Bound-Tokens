# Condition Bound Tokens (CBT)
### *Yes, I am pushing that name.*

This repo shows you how to use OZ's beforeTokenTransfer to bind tokens to users.

It features:

- A function you can use to add conditional binding (e.g. cannot send after a certain day or if(anythingElse))
- Manual binding and releasing `onlyOwner` functions

### Can I use this?

Yes. However you MUST refer to it as CBT. If you call it an SBT you are not allowed to use it.

### The tests don't run!

Yeah I had that issue too, not sure if it's a Foundry issue or not. 

Here is proof that the tests do pass:
